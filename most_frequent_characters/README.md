# MOST FREQUENT CHARACTER

## DESCRIPTION

Write a function, most_frequent_char, that takes in a string as an argument. The function should return the most frequent character of the string. If there are ties, return the character that appears earlier in the string.

For example, the most frequent character of 'abca' is 'a'. The characters 'a' and 'b' both appear twice, but 'a' appears earlier in the string.

You can assume the following:

```python
most_frequent_char('bookeeper') # -> 'e'
most_frequent_char('david') # -> 'd'
most_frequent_char('mississippi') # -> 'i'
```

# Pairs

a function, pairs, that takes in a list as an argument. The function should return a list containing all unique pairs of elements.

Steps:

1. Define the function `pairs` that takes a list as an argument.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the pairs.
3. Use a nested loop to iterate through the list and create pairs.
4. Ensure that each pair is unique by checking if it already exists in the list of pairs.
5. Return the list of pairs.
